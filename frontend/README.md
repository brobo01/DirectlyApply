To run code:

- Download from Github
- Navigate to the frontend folder in terminal
- Type `yarn` into terminal to download packages
- Type `yarn start` into terminal to run the development server

For this I have used React to allow further uses of state and async communcation with the backend and to allow the use of development packages in React.

The major constraint in this was time. If I had additional time, I would further develop this by adding in tests to check the form works.
